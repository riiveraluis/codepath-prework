**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Luis Rivera Rivera**

Time spent: **8:30** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
* [x] User can split the bill with people and display how much each person has to pay.
* [x] The app uses on launch whatever currency the device region is set up and then uses the currency the person set in the settings screen.
* [x] The app has a setting screen where tip percentages and currency can be customized.
* [x] The app uses user defaults as data persistance between laaunches and during app usage.
* [x] More streamlined design across settings screen and main screen.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It was a challenge how to configure the different currencies, because I didn't know about the methods and because of using Xcode 14 beta some of the methods were already deprecated. Also, although not too difficult, getting back to programming with UIKIT after using SwiftUI for a while. It makes me value how simplified it is to program with it. I am aware that the UIKit code base will always be there, and making this application made me enjoy both.
